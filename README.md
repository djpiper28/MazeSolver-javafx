# MazeSolver
Takes a while to load the maze but the alg is fast. Just run the jar and load up a maze. The maze should be black and white WITH NO JPEG COMPRESSION and have a black border with a two white holes to represent the start and end.
The program opens an image and then renders it output as it executes then it saves the output and closes.
The width of the white parts of the maze must be 1 pixel!
